# 21st Century Anglerfish

This mod is a complete meme.

It's built to make the anglerfish a little less intimidating (though for some, it may do the opposite).

Anglerfish will no longer chase you, but instead when they hear you, they'll just look and stare after making a vine boom sound effect, and then continue staring until you leave.
